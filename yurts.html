                <dd>Each yurt is furnished with a queen-sized bed with down quilt and gas-fired stove. Your luxury camping experience includes electricity and a sink with hot and cold running water. Shower and restroom facilities are located in the lodge.</dd>
                <dt><b>What should I bring?</b></dt>
                <dd>Most guests pack comfortable walking shoes and plan to dress for changing weather with light layers of clothing. It's also helpful to bring a flashlight for a sense of adventure!</dd>
